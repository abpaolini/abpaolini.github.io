	<p>I graduated in 2016 from UC Santa Cruz, with a degree in Cognitive Science. When it comes to my interests and areas of expertise, I consider myself a jack of all trades. Aside from the navigation bar above, this entire website was made by me from scratch. As someone who has mainly coded in C and related languages, I built this website both to show prospective employers, and as a challenge for myself.</p>
	<p>I am fascinated by the connections between the disciplines of behavioral science, economics, and politics. These three disciplines are highly interconnected—in fact, I would say much of politics is just applied psychology.</p>
	<p>I have spent much of the last year attending meetings and volunteering with political organizations. I volunteered and helped organize the Civics Summit in Santa Cruz County, where we gathered students from around the county's high schools to meet with elected representatives, including City, County, and State officials.</p>
	<p>I am extremely passionate about history, government, and politics, which is part of what makes me an excellent teacher for people trying to learn these subjects. I can often explain things in a way that makes even those who believe these subjects are simply boring to them to realize how interesting they can be.</p>

	<p>I love working with animals—I am very good at working with dogs in particular. I enjoy working outside and don't mind doing manual labor when it comes to clearing brush or taking care of a park—that is, as long as there aren't any stinging insects around.</p>
	<p>In Winter, I went to elementary school classrooms to teach them about Channukah, along with my family. I explained the history behind Channukah, including the Menorah and the game of Dreidal. In the thank-you cards that were sent back to us from the students, several remarked how I made it interesting to learn about history.</p>
